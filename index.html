   <p>In 2014, 18.1% (or 43.6 million) adults had 'any mental illness' (AMI) in the past year. AMI is defined as having any mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder in the past year that met DSM-IV criteria (excluding developmental disorders and SUDs). 'Serious mental illness' (SMI) is defined as AMI adults who have had any mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder that substantially interfered with or limited one or more major life activities.</p>
